# React Seminar

Presentation files for the React.js seminar held at Codibee and presented by me,
explaining the main assets of React & Redux with diagrams, hands-on example and 
step-by-step explanation in order to be able to repeat the seminar at any time.

## Presentation Flow

- Starting of is probably recommended with the "ES6 examples" file, in case the developers
are not familiar with newer Javascript syntax.

- Next up, the "React presentation - Slides", to view and discuss the main React aspects and
other important libraries like Redux, React Router & Axios.

- Lastly, we're going right up onto writing code, with an example using the Wordpress build-in API
to create a simple blog site. ("src" and "public" folders).
